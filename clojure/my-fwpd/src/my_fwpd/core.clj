;; Exercises

;; The vampire analysis program you now have is already decades ahead of anything
;; else on the market. But how could you make it better? I suggest trying the
;; following:

;; 1. Turn the result of your glitter filter into a list of names.

(map :name row-maps)

;; => ("Edward Cullen" "Jacob Black" "Carlisle Cullen")


;; 2. Write a function, append, which will append a new suspect to your list of
;; suspects.

(defn map->file
  [row-map]
  (spit filename (str (s/join "," (vals row-map)) "\n") :append true)
 )
(map->file {:name "yuanxin" :glitter-index 23234})



;; 3. Write a function, validate, which will check that :name and :glitter-index
;; are present when you append. The validate function should accept two arguments:
;; a map of keywords to validating functions, similar to conversions, and the
;; record to be validated.

(defn valid
  [filename]
  (let [last-row (last (file->seqmaps filename))
        not-nil? (complement nil?)]
    (def kvf-map {:name not-nil? :glitter-index not-nil?})
    (some not-nil?
          (map #((get kvf-map %) (get last-row %))
               (keys last-row))))
)
(valid filename)



;; 4. Write a function that will take your list of maps and convert it back to a
;; CSV string. Youâ€™ll need to use the clojure.string/join function.

;; Good luck, McFishwich!

;; seq of maps -> file
(def row-maps (file->seqmaps filename))

(defn seqmaps->file
  [seqmaps]
  (spit filename (reduce #(str %1 %2) "" (map #(str (s/join "," %) "\n") (map #(vals %) seqmaps)))
        :append true)
  )
(seqmaps->file row-maps)


(defn -main
  "I don't do a whole lot ... yet."
  [& args]
  (println "Hello, World!"))
